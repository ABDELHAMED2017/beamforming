# Beamforming
Matlab files for various types of beamforming for custom 1D and 2D arrays

- Calculate and look at beampattern/array pattern/array factor for 1D and 2D arrays
- Calculate and look at beampattern for delay-and-sum and minimum variance beamformers
- Create input signals with multiple sources of the same single frequency arriving at different angles and with different sources
- Calculate steered response for delay-and-sum, minimum variance, MUSIC and functional beamforming algorithm
- Plot the steered response with dynamic range slider and context menu to switch between 2D/3D view
